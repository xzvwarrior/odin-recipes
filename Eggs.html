        You will need the following ingredients to cook eggs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1-2 eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon of butter or Olive Oil
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt & Pepper
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>First you should crack your egg open into a bowl, making sure to not have any egg shell shards getting into your bowl.</p>
    <p>Spinkle in some salt and pepper into the eggs and then take a fork and whisk the eggs until they're completely homogenous,  </p>
    <p>Place butter or oil into pain at a medium heat and allow it to get to temperature before pouring your egg mixture into the pan.</p>
    <p>Allow for the eggs to cook for about 2 minutes or until the egg has began to "Set"(where it's no longer as watery) and then flip the eggs over using a spatula.</p>
    <p>When this side is cooked through add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste and plate it.</p>
