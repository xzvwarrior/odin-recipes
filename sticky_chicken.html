    <h1>How to make Sticky chicken</h1>
    <p>You will need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Thighs</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>Chopped onion</li>
        <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>Freshly grounded Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Begin by seasoning your chicken thighs with the cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper.</p>
    <p>In your pot take your olive oil and coat the bottom of it very well, when spreading try to coat the sides of the pot as well to prevent sticking to sides while stirring.</p>
    <p>Drop you chopped onions into the pot and begin to stir, stirring for about 10-15 minutes to allow the onions to properly brown. <strong> The constant stirring will prevent the onions from burning and carmelize.</strong> Adding some salt to the onions at this stage will help draw out some moisture to help with browning.</p>
    <p>After letting the onions properly brown go ahead and add your minced garlic, stirring for about 20-40s, until fragrant, and then adding in your chicken thighs.</p>\
    <p>Keep stirring your chicken thighs until they're coated in the onions and garlic and are beginning to cook, then go ahead and cover. The fat rendering from the chicken thighs will help prevent everything from burning and will reduce into a nice gravy.</p>
    <p>Check on the chicken every few minutes to make sure nothing is burning, occassionally giving it a stir to allow even cooking on all sides.</p>
    <p>Eat over rice and enjoy!</p>
